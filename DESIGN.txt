This file is to document funny design decisions that may be 
non-obvious from the code.
=====================================================================
The length of database identifiers is set to 20 digits using
MySQL's bigint. We do not need to do any arithmetic on the ids
in the application and making them big prevents any such attempts
from being straightforward as a bonus. The long ids mean that we
have less of a concern for things like brute-forcing the whole
id space and have less chance of collisions when using random ids.
At the same time the DB works with those quite nicely.

The plugin has several tables to try and keep different conserns 
separated. For the application, the plugin exposes a special
read-only model that works off a database view combining the
necessary (or, rather, desired) fields for easier access.
