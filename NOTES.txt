To pick up the i18n strings from the plugin use
./Console/cake i18n extract --plugin Z --overwrite --extract-core no
If just ./Console/cake i18n is used, Model strings are not picked.
The "domain" for the plugin i18n must be lowercase, i.e. 'z'.

Make sure your CSS stylesheet does not screw up the rendering
of the jqplot elements. One example I came across is the legend
of the plot is a table, so it will pick up customizations of
the tables. Use this for your table customization in site CSS:
table:not(.jqplot-table-legend):not(.jqplot-highlighter) {
	...
}
