1.0.0	Important! The db schema has changed!

	This is the release that is now live.
	Many small changes went into it but nothing
	so much ground-breaking, just usig it in 
	a real system helps with making it useful :)

0.7.0	Important! The db schema has changed!

	I give up on the idea to not use a user name. For
	one, you do not always get an e-mail address from
	third parties. For another, the users seem perplexed
	by the idea of not having a user name from the start.
	We shall be more conventional from now on.

	E-mail is a part of the password identification
	table as the one means of authentication we control.
	The user name is the main attribute of the account
	(the user id stays as the primary key). The user view
	will include both the user name and a slug so we can
	have uniform addressing throughout the application.

0.6.0	Important! The db schema has changed!

	In this version we move to the multiple records for
	good and bad login attempts to keep track of things.
	That will perhaps require clean-up of the login 
	log table later.
	This requires changing the 'users' view so if you
	are upgrading, look into the schema (Schema/z.sql),
	delete the table 'z_account_logins' and the view 
	'users' and create the new table and all views from
	the new schema.
	The new schema provides the same 'users' view as 
	before, so no code changes required if you rely on it.
