0.6.0	Important! The db schema has changed!

	In this version we move to the multiple records for
	good and bad login attempts to keep track of things.
	That will perhaps require clean-up of the login 
	log table later.
	This requires changing the 'users' view so if you
	are upgrading, look into the schema (Schema/z.sql),
	delete the table 'z_account_logins' and the view 
	'users' and create the new table and all views from
	the new schema.
	The new schema provides the same 'users' view as 
	before, so no code changes required if you rely on it.
