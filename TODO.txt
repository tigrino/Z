 - Normally we need to detect failures of the RNG... but we do not want to do statistical testing every time, do we?
 - Make SSL configurable (switch off/enforce/combined(like now))
 - Add a component for filtering and immediately comparing the length to return whether filtering affected an input string. This will make checking for invalid input characters and throwing errors easy. Otherwise "clean" may change your password and you would not know.

 - Store the timestamp in forms and make sure that the requests are neither submitted in a very short time e.g. < 2 sec nor after an extended waiting time > ? hours (csrf already expires after 1 hr though...)
 - Keep a log of requests for a session and throw a captcha when something suspicious happens, like invalid login 3 times in a row...
 - Get the 7 segments captcha (any other?) implemented and make it configurable
 - Generally, see what has to be configurable and make it so
 - Support external authentication: Facebook, Google, ?..
 - Additional cookie for "secure-only" to verify the session was not highjacked while on insecure channel
 - "Remember me" function with proper multiple token+cookie management
 - learn how to automate and write tests
