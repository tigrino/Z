	Z authentication and account management plugin for CakePHP
	by Albert 'Tigr' Zenkoff <albert@tigr.net>

A Bit Of Philosophy
===================

The state of security overall in most projects is miserable. This is
rather annoying to see knowing well that the tools are available, the
knowledge is accessible and there is no excuse for not making things
more secure. So I decided to do a little bit on this front and here
is the user authentication and management plugin that is already fairly
secure but I intend to make it even more so.

What's so different?
 - it disposes with the MD5 hashing of passwords with a fixed salt 
   in favor of the SHA512 hashing with a randomly generated salt.
   The former is ... funny, the latter is fairly secure even if your
   password database is stolen (and that happens more often than you
   think).
 - All identifiers are 20 digit long numbers. They are randomly
   generated where it matters (user record id) and they are simply
   auto-incremented where I think it is of no importance.
   The practice of using UUID for a user id is just wrong, the UUID
   is not unpredictable.
 - The user is identified by an email address. Internally, a user has
   also an ID but the external identifier is the email address.
   I think nowadays that's the accepted standard and it works for
   using external authentication as well (think Facebook/Google etc.)
   We simply do not need the user name (the name still can be part of
   the user profile on your site).
 - The user registration is confirmed by e-mail. There is a lot that
   can be done here but let's face it - that's the accepted practice.
 - If any strange behavior is detected, the user is logged out 
   immediately just in case.
 - The user authentication is kept completely separate from all
   other things, there is no link to any authorization scheme or
   anything else. This plugin tries to make just one thing well.
   Once you have the user ID, you use it in your own authorization
   scheme, of course.

I am not saying that what you get is the ultimate in site security.
However, looking at what people throw together for their site user
management, I think they better use this. At least as a starting 
point.

Potential problems
==================

Since I write the plugin for a particular site and function it may
have things that you are not interested in. You have two ways.
You can wait until I get around to making things configurable and
more flexible. Or you can help making it better. Guess which 
I will appreciate more?

Installation
============

The plugin is written for the 2.2 release originally. What happens
on the other releases I do not know.

I install like this:
1. Put it in your Plugin/Z folder.
2. Add the following to Config/bootstrap.php

	CakePlugin::load(
		array(
		'Z' => array('bootstrap' => true, 'routes' => true)
		)
	);
	Configure::write ('Z.email_from', 'info@yoursite.com');
	Configure::write ('Z.site_title', 'Your Site');

3. Use the schemas in the plugin's Config/Schema directory
   to create the tables and add the first user
   user name is YOURNAME@EXAMPLE.COM
   password is 'password'
   Don't forget to change the name and the password!
   That'll be your user admin.

The authentication is done through the standard CakePHP Auth module,
so you just call on the things like $this->Auth->user() and
$this->Session->read('Auth.User') to get to the user data.

For authentication forward people to /z/accounts/login
and for logging them out - to /z/accounts/logout
For registration forward them to /z/accounts/register
User info page is available at /z/users/view

Good luck!
